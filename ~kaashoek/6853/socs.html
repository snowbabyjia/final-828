<h1>Call for Papers for First MIT Student Symposium on Computer Systems (SOCS)</h1>

<blockquote><p>	December ??, 1996<br>
	NE43-518, Cambridge, MA, USA<br>
                                                                   
<p>	Neena Lyall, MIT, General Chair<br>
	Frans Kaashoek, MIT, Program Chair<br></blockquote>

<p>Students in 6.853 are required to submit papers to the First SOCS describing
original research related to the design, implementation, and analysis of
computer systems. We encourage papers about systems issues on a wide range of
platforms, including embedded and portable computers, workstations, high
performance machines, and production environments. Preference will be given to
papers of unusual novelty or unusual practicality, papers whose authors ensure
replicable results (e.g., by making available source code), and papers
critiquing prior work or continuing a significant research dialogue. We seek a
broad conference of high relevance and high quality.

<p>The field of operating systems is closely tied to other areas of computer
science such as computer architecture, data communications, programming systems,
and applications. The Symposium attracts attendees with diverse backgrounds, and
we explicitly solicit papers not only in the "traditional core" of the field,
but also in the interface to these other areas. Topics of interest include, but
are not restricted to:

<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>

<tr> <td>Multiprocessor systems
     <td>Ubiquitous computing
     <td>Performance tools and techniques
     <br>

<tr> <td>Languages and Programming    
     <td>Support for multimedia 
     <td>Transactional approaches     

<tr>  <td>I/O and file systems    
      <td>Real-time systems
      <td>Low Power OS

<tr>  <td>High-Performance systems     
      <td>Heterogeneous systems    
      <td>Mobile Computing

<tr> <td>The architecture / OS interface Distributed systems   
     <td>System structure and organization
     <br>

<tr> <td>Communications
     <td>Reliability
     <td>Security
     <br>
</table>           
                                 
<p>Blind reviewing of full papers will be done by the program committee. Papers
must use a typeface no smaller than 10 point, and be no longer than ten (10)
8.5x11 or A4 pages including everything (references, title page, appendices,
etc.); the Program Chair will shred papers exceeding these limits. The title of
the paper and the authors' names and addresses, and if possible, an e-mail
address for the contact author, should appear on a cover sheet accompanying the
paper. Authors must NOT be identified in the paper itself, either explicitly or
by reference or acknowledgement.
                                   
<p>Program Committee: Students and Staff in 6.853

<p>Please send twenty copies of your paper (double sided if possible) to the
Program Chair: Frans Kaashoek (kaashoek@lcs.mit.edu).

<p>Deadline for receipt of submissions: December 4, 1996
<p>Acceptance notification: December 11, 1996
<p>Deadline for FTP-ready and camera-ready final papers: December TBA, 1996
