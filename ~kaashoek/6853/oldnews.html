<p><h2>Mock-area exam paper is due on Oct. 16</h2>

The mock-area exam paper is due on Oct. 16.  This paper should be maximally 5
pages and should contrast your reseach project with previous research.  Your
paper should address what the related research is, what the weaknesses in
previous research is, and how your proposal will add to the area of research you
are targetting.  It should not be a "book review" style paper, but rather point
out directions, opinions, flaws, etc.
