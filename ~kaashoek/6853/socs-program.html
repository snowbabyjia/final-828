<h1>First MIT Student Symposium on Computer Systems (SOCS)</h1>

<blockquote><p>	January 24, 1997<br>
	NE43-518, MIT LCS, Cambridge, MA, USA<br>
                                                                   
<p>	Neena Lyall, MIT, General Chair<br>
	Frans Kaashoek, MIT, Program Chair<br></blockquote>

<p> Students in 6.853 are required to submit papers to the First SOCS
describing original research related to the design, implementation, and
analysis of computer systems. We encourage papers about systems issues on a
wide range of platforms, including embedded and portable computers,
workstations, high performance machines, and production
environments. Preference will be given to papers of unusual novelty or
unusual practicality, papers whose authors ensure replicable results (e.g.,
by making available source code), and papers critiquing prior work or
continuing a significant research dialogue. We seek a broad conference of
high relevance and high quality.

<p>From the 22 papers submitted 14 papers have been selected for
presentation.  Each paper was reviewed by 4 students, and 3 program
committees recommended 12 papers.  From the recommended papers the
program chair selected 14 papers.

<p>The symposium is in NE43-518 on Friday, January 24, 1997.  The format is
20 minutes per presentation (10 minutes presentation with 10 minutes
discussion).  Lunch will be provided by the program chair.
