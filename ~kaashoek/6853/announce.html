<h1>6.853: First MIT Student Symposium on Computer Systems (SOCS)</h1>

<p>The goal of 6.853 is learn to do research in computer systems.  6.853 will
involve learning to critique papers/ideas, picking a research topic, building a
system/executing a project, analyzing the results, writing it up in a
conference-quality paper, and creating an effective presentation.  6.853 is
intended for Course 6 Meng students and MS/PhD students.

<h2>Method</h2>
</ul>
<li>Study, discuss, and critically judge the recent literature of computer
systems.
<li>Execute a research project in teams of two/three by implementing a 
cool idea, evaluating it, and writing a 10-page paper on it.
</ul>

<h2>Topics covered</h2>
<p> Computer architecture, networks, operating systems,
programming language/system interface, network protocols, file systems,
replication, protection, transactions, database systems, computer graphics, user
interfaces, and application systems.

<h2>Project</h2> 

<p>Projects are done in teams of maximal 3 students. Suggestions for topics for
projects will be provided by the staff, but you are free to make your own
proposal for a project. Some of the suggested projects will be executed using
the exokernel operating system.  Projects may overlap with the research for your
thesis (if the thesis is in the area of computer systems and your advisor
does not mind).

<h2>Mechanics</h2>
<ul>
<li>Class meets twice a week for 1.5 hours:
<ul>
<li>Lecturer gives a general intro to the area
<li>Student gives a 20 minute presentation on the selected paper (requires doing
additional background reading)
<li>The rest of the class meeting is devoted to discussion of the
selected paper and project reports.
</ul>
<li>Students are required to write 4 pieces of text:
<ul>
<li>One-page research progress reports
<li>A 5-page mock area exam report covering the background of the project
<li>A 10-page research papers (see CFP for SOCS).
</ul>
<li>Grading:
<ul>
<li>Participation in class
<li>Quality of 20-minute presentation
<li>Quality of progress reports
<li>Qaulity of mock-area exam paper
<li>Quality of paper
<li>Quality of final presentation at the symposium
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Prereq</h2>
<p> Highly motivated to do some cool hacking and sufficient
background in the areas of 6.004, 6.033, 6.035, and 6.170 (or equivalents
thereof)

<h2>Collaboration policy</h2>

Do the right thing.  Individual assignments are for an individual and team
assignments are for teams.
