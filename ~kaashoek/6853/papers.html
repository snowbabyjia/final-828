<h1>6.853 Readings</h1>

<p>For each class meeting one hard-core technical paper is assigned.  In
addition, some background reading is suggested.  You are expected to read the
paper assigned in preparation of the class meeting.  The student who presents
the paper is also required to do some of the background reading. Other students
are strongly encouraged to do at least a cursory read of the background
material.<br>

<P> Electronic versions are linked where available; see the course secretary for
paper copies. We will try to handout hardcopies of the assigned reading a week
in advance in class. <br>


<h2>September 4</h2>

<li>2. <EM>Rules for Referees</EM><BR> Bernard K. Forscher, reprinted
from SCIENCE, Vol. 150, pp 319-321, October 1965.

</ul>

Another good piece of advice on what is a good paper is Roy Levin's and David
D. Redell's <em>An evaluation of the ninth SOSP submissions, or how (and how
not) to write a good systems paper</em>. Operating Systems Review 17, 3 (July,
1983) pages 35-40.<br>

<h2>September 16</h2>

<ul>

<LI>5. <a
href="ftp://www-flash.stanford.edu/pub/hive/SOSP95-oschar.ps"><EM>The Impact
of Architectural Trends on Operating System Performance</EM></a>
M. Rosenblum, E. Bugnion, S. A. Herrod, E. Witchel, and A. Gupta
(Stanford). This paper appeared in SOSP-15, Dec. 1995.<br>

</ul>

<p>This paper uses the SimOS environment for simulating the architectural
trends. <a href="http://www-flash.stanford.edu:80/Embra/">Embra</a> is the key
component of the system that makes the SimOS environment fast enough so that
real systems can be simulated.  Since this paper is all about modern
uniprocessors and multiprocessors, it might be helpful to check out <em>Computer
Architecture: a quantative approach (2nd ed)</em>, by Hennesey and Patterson,
Morgan Kaufmann publishers.<br>

<p>Another interesting performance study is <a
href="http://www.das.harvard.edu/users/faculty/Brad_Chen/ftp/p5.ps"><EM> The
Measured Performance of Personal Computer Operating Systems</EM></a>
J.B. Chen, Y. Endo, K. Chan, D. Mazieres, A. Dias, M. Seltzer, M.D.
Smith (Harvard). It uses the performance counters of the Pentium to study
applications running on NetBSD, Windows95, Windows/NT.<br>

<h2>September 18</h2>

Operating System Architecture for Application-Level Resource Management</EM></a>
D.R. Engler, M.F. Kaashoek and J. O'Toole, Jr. (MIT Lab for Computer Science)
This paper appeared in SOSP-15, Dec. 1995.<br>

</ul>

<p>There is quite a bit of current discussion on what an appropriate
organization for an operating system is.  This paper discusses one
approach. Next week's paper discusses yet another approach.  The <a
href="http://borneo.gmd.de/RS/L4/sosp95.ps"><EM>On Micro-Kernel
Construction</EM></a> paper, which also appeared in SOSP-15, argues the
microkernel organization is just fine; one has to implement them right.<br>

<h2>September 25</h2>

<ul>

Becker, Susan Eggers, Craig Chambers.  (Department of Computer Science and
Engineering, University of Washington).

</ul>

</p>The SPIN paper discusses yet another approach to obtaining flexibility.  The
SPIN approach relies on downloading user modules written in a type-safe
language into the operating system kernel. Checkout <a <a
href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/spin/www/index.html">the
SPIN page</a> for more info.  A related paper that investigates the type-safe
languages for operating systems is <em>Pilot: an operating system for
a personal computer</em>, by David D. Redell, Yogen K. Dalal, Thomas R. Horsley,
Hugh C. Lauer, William C. Lynch, Paul R. McJones, Hal g. Murray, and Stephen
C. Purcell, which appeared in Communications of the ACM, vol 23, no 2,

pp. 98-110. Only available in hardcopy. <br>

</ul>

<p>This paper discusses the design and implementation of a switch for an
ATM-style network.  Another good paper that describes a complete ATM-like
network is Rodeheffer, Edwin H. Satterthwaite, and Charles P. Thacker. Autonet:

<h2>October 7</h2>
<ul>
<li>10. <a href="http://www.tns.lcs.mit.edu/publications/ccr96.html">Towards an
Active Networks</a>, D. Tennenhouse and D. Wetherall, to appear in ACM SIGCOMM
CCR.
</ul>

<p>This paper describes a radically-different architecture for structuring
networks: protocols are replaced by programs.  As background reading you should
read Architectural Considerations for a New Generation of Protocols, D.D. Clark
and D.L. Tennenhouse, Proc. SIGCOMM 90 Symposium on Communications Architectures
and Protocols, Philadelphia, PA, Sept. 1990, 200-208.<br>

<li>11. Efficient and Language-independent mobile programs", A. Adl-Tabatabai,
G. Langdale, S. Lucco, and R. Wahbe.  PLDI'96, pp 127-136.
</ul>

<p>Another timely topic: mobile code.  A different approaches are explored to
run code safely in another domain.  The destination domain can either be the
kernel (as in SPIN, Exokernel, or Vino) or be another processor (as in Java and
Omniware).  The different techniques used to ensure safety are sandboxing (ie.,
software fault isolation), type-safe languages (SPIN and Java), and <a
href="http://foxnet.cs.cmu.edu/people/petel/papers/osdi">self-certifying
code</a>.

<h2>October 16</h2>
<ul>
<li>12. Authentication in the Taos Operating System", by E. Wobber, M. Abadi,
M. Burrows, and B. Lampson, ACM Trans. on Computer Systems, vol. 12, no 1,
Feb. 1994, pp 2-32.
</ul>

<p>The papers in the previous class meeting demonstrate the need for security
and discusses techniques.  This paper describes a complete design and
implementation of security in a distributed system.  It uses authentication
logic to reason about the security properties of the system.  Check out
"Authentication in distributed systems: theory and practice" by Lampson et al.,
ACM Trans. on Computer Systems, vol 10, no 4, Nov. 1992, pp 265-310 for the

D. Bonin, A. Mason, and C. Kahn, Proc. of the 1990 IEEE Symposium on Security
and Privacy, 7-9 May 1990, Oakland, CA, pp 2-19.
</ul>

<p>This paper descibes what it takes to build an operating system capable of
receiving an A1 rating.  The various ratings are described in the <a
href="http://www.v-one.com/newpages/obook.html">Orange Book</a>.<br>

and easy to manage.  Petal is an alternative to RAID: Randy H. Katz, Garth
A. Gibson, and David A. Patterson. Disk system architectures for high
performance computing. Proceedings of the IEEE 77, 12 (December, 1989) pages
1842-1857.<br>

<h2>October 28</h2>
<ul>
<li>15. Scalability in the XFS file system, Adam Sweeney, Proc. of the USENIX
1996 Annual Technical Conference, San Diego, Jan. 1996.
</ul>

<p>The literature on file system is huge.  The XFS file system is a state-of-the
art file system supporting large files, large number of files, large
directories, and high performance I/O.  The background reading for this paper is
Fast File System (FFS), McKusick, M. Joy, W. Leffler, S. Fabry, ACM Trans. on
Computer Systems, Vol. 2, No. 3, Aug. 1984, pp. 181-197.<br>

<h2>October 30</h2>

D. Patterson, D. Roselli, and R. Wang, ACM Trans. on Computer Systems,
vol. 14, no 1, Feb. 1996, pp. 41-79.
</ul>

<p>Serverless is a total misnomer, but the paper describes a radical approach to
building distributed file systems.  The background reading for this paper is
RAID (see above), LFS (Mendel Rosenblum and John K. Ousterhout. The design and
implementation of a log-structured file system. Proceedings of the Thirteenth
ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, Pacific Grove, California October
13-16, 1991, pages 1-15), and <a href="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/people/jhh/zebra_tocs.ps.gz">Zebra</a> (The Zebra Striped Network File System,
J.K. Hartman and J.K. Ousterhout. Proceedings of the Fourteenth ACM Symposium on
Operating System Principles, Asheville, California, pp.  29-43).  The prototype
serveless file system is called xFS, not to be confused with XFS (see
above). <br>

of the 15th Symp. on Operating System Principles, Dec. 1995, pp. 201-212.
</ul>

<p>This paper is the first of two paper on global memory management from the
University of Washington.  The follow-on on this paper appeared last month at <a
href="http://cag-www.lcs.mit.edu/asplos7/">ASPLOS</a> and discusses an
optimization on the first paper.  The optimization involves sending subpages
instead of sending complete pages.<br>

<h2>November 6</h2>

WebCrawler. B. Pinkerton. 2nd Int. Conf. on WWWW. 1994, pp 821-829.<br>
</ul>

<p>The topic for November 13 is searching in the Internet.  A hot and fast
moving area of research.  To cover some of the different issue two
light-weight papers are assigned.  The first paper is one of the <a
href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/homes/schwartz/public_html/resource_location.html">Harvest</a>
papers.  The other paper is one of the first papers on Web crawlers. Of
course, you are encourages to check out other search tools, such as Alta
Vista, Yahoo, etc.<br>

<h2>November 18</h2>

<ul>
<li>21. Rover: a toolkit for mobile information access.  A.D. Joseph,
A.F. deLespinasse, J.A. Tauber, D.K. Gifford, and M. Frans Kaashoek.  Proc.
of the 15th SOSP, Dec. 1995.<br>
</ul>

<p>This is the first of two class meetings on mobile computing.  We will
first take an application perspective on mobile computing by studying <a
href="http://www.rover.lcs.mit.edu/">Rover</a>.  Rover was inspired and
builds on pioneering work done at CMU on <a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/coda/Web/coda.html">Coda</a>, a
file system for disconnected computing.  Mobile computing is a hot and
growing research area; recently ACM started a new conference <a
href="http://www.acm.org/sigmobile/conf/mobicom96/">Mobicom</a> on this
topic.<br>

<h2>November 20</h2>

<ul>
<li>22. <a
href="ftp://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dbj/ftp/mobile/kluwer-ietf.ps">Scalable Support
for Transparent Mobile Host Internetworking>, David B. Johnson, Ninth IEEE
Workshop on Computer Communications, 1994. (revision) <br>
</ul>

<p>In this class meeting we will take a networking perspective on mobile
computing.  In particular, we will focus on Mobile IP, a new protocol to
make IP work when hosts are moving.  Mobile IP is in the process of being
standarized by the <a
href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/mobileip-charter.html">Mobile IP
working group</a>.<br>

<h2>November 25</h2>

<ul>
<li>23. <a href="http://cag-www.lcs.mit.edu/asplos7/program/">Shasta: A Low
Overhead, Software-Only Approach for Supporting Fine-Grain Shared
Memory</a>. Daniel J. Scales, Kourosh Gharachorloo: Digital WRL and
Chandramohan A. Thekkath: Digital SRC.<br>
</ul>

<p>Early on the term we read about multiprocessors that provided
distributed shared memory in hardware.  This paper reports on the latest
advance in implementing distributed shared memory on software.  There are
zillion of other papers on software distributed shared memory.  It is
probably the most popular PhD. thesis topic in systems of the last decade.
The Shasta work references many of these other projects; feel free to
check them all out.<br>


<h2>November 27</h2>

<li>24. Network Objects. A. Birrell, G. Nelson, S. Owicki, E. Wobber.
14th Symp. on Operating System Principles, pp. 217-230.<br>
</ul>

<p>A recent paper from DEC SRC on distributed network objects.  Most of the
issue discussed in this paper appear are at the hart of other systems, such
as distributed OLE-2 (or Active-X), Java's Remote Method Invocation
package, CORBA, etc.  This paper is different from all the hype in that it
gives a crisp and clear description of what the problems are, how these
problems were solved, and what the performance issues are.<br>

<h2>December 2</h2>
<ul>
<li>25. Fast, effective dynamic compilation.  J. Auslander, M. Philipose,
G. Chaimbers, S.J. Eggers, and B.N. Bershad.  Proc. PLDI '96,

that appeared at the last PLDI on this topic.<br>

<h2>December 4</h2>
<ul>
<li>26. Receiver-driven layered multicast.  S. McCanne and V. Jacobson.
SIGCOMM'96, pp. 117-130.<br>
</ul>

<p>A cool paper to make video conferencing over the Internet better.<br>
