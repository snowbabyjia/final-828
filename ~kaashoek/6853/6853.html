<p><h2>Final paper due on Dec. 4</h2>

<p>After our discussion on Wednesday about reviews, I thought you might be
interested in the process.  What we will do is the following:
<ul>
<li> On Dec. 4 you submit 6 copies of your paper (hardcopies), bring
	  them to class.  Dec. 4 is a hard hard deadline.
<li> I will assign each paper a number.
<li> We divide them across the class.  Each of you will read 4 papers.
	  (Make sure that you identify conflicts: ie. you are not allowed
          to review your own paper or a paper of your friend.)  
<li> After reading them, you will fill out a <a href="review.txt">review
form</a> for each paper assigned to you, and send them to me by email by
	  Dec. 9, midnight.
<li> I'll rank the papers on their collective scores, tabulate the
          results and reports, and we discuss the top papers in class.
</ul>

<p>This process is pretty similar to the process that a real _systems_
conference would follow.  (The procedure differs from field to field.)  In
fact, the enclosed review form is the one that has been used for OSDI,
ASPLOS, SOSP, etc.

<p>The area for specific comments is the space where you can identify specific
strenghts and weaknesses of the paper.  The typical structure of this
section is a one or two paragraph summary of the paper (so that the rest of
the committee can figure out what the paper is about), followed by your
review.

<p>Some people write long reviews, some write short ones.  The comments are
intended to be constructive; they go back to the authors so that they can
improve their papers.  So comments like "The idea in this paper is stupid;
I do not like it" are bad comments; comments of the following form are fine:

<p>The ideas in this paper are fantastic, but the implementation does not
	support the stated claims.  For example, in Section 7 the authors state
	that the world is square but from previous experiments (see the
	paper "The world is a triangle" by Smith in the last SOCS) we know
	that the world is a triangle.  I therefore think we should reject
	this paper.

<p>Please, if you have any comments about the process and review forms, send
me email or raise them in class.

<p>I strongly encourage everyone to submit their project paper, even if your
project is not completely finished yet, or your paper is not as strong as
you wish it would be.  First, idea papers can be very interesting (e.g.,
active networks paper).  Second, you will not be the only one who has an
unfinished project.  Third, the reviews might contain useful comments that
might help you in strenghtening your work (e.g., for your thesis).  Four,
submitting is required if you want a passing grade for 6.853.
