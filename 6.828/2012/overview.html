6.828: Learning by doing
</H2>
</CENTER>

<p>
6.828 teaches the fundamentals of engineering operating systems.
You will study, in detail, virtual memory, kernel and user mode, system
calls, threads, context switches, interrupts, interprocess
communication, coordination of concurrent activities, and the
interface between software and hardware.  Most importantly, you will
study the interactions between these concepts, and how to manage the
complexity introduced by the interactions.

<p>
To master the concepts, 6.828 is organized in three parts: lectures,
readings, and a major lab.  The lectures and readings familiarize you
with the main concepts. The lab forces you to understand the concepts
at a deep level, since you will build an operating system from the
ground up. After the lab you will appreciate the meaning of design
goals such "reducing complexity" and "conceptual integrity".

<p>
The lectures are organized in two main blocks.  The first block
introduces one operating system, <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/xv6-book/index.html"<i>xv6
(x86 version 6)</i></a>, which is a re-implementation of Unix Version
6, which was developed in the 1970s. In each lecture we will take one
part of xv6 and study its source code; homework assignments will help
you prepare for these lectures.  At the end of the first block (about
half-way the term), you will understand the source code for one
well-designed operating system for an Intel-based PC, which help you
building your own operating system.

<p>The second block of lectures covers important operating systems
concepts invented after Unix v6.  We will study the more modern
concepts by reading research papers and discussing them in lecture.
You will also implement some of these newer concepts in your operating
system.

<p>You may wonder why we are studying an operating system that
resembles Unix v6 instead of the latest and greatest version of Linux,
Windows, or BSD Unix.  xv6 is big enough to illustrate the basic
design and implementation ideas in operating systems.  On the other
hand, xv6 is far smaller than any modern production O/S, and
correspondingly easier to understand.  xv6 has a structure similar to
many modern operating systems; once you've explored xv6 you will find
much that is familiar inside kernels such as Linux.

<p>The lab is the place where the rubber meets the road.  In the lab
you will internalize the details of the concepts and their
interactions.  For example, although you have seen virtual memory in
6.004, 6.033, and again in 6.828 lectures, you will soon discover,
during the labs, that you didn't really understand virtual memory and
how it interacts with other concepts.

<p>The lab is split into 6 major parts that build on each
other, culminating in a primitive operating system on which you
can run simple commands through your own shell.  We reserve the last
lecture for you to demo your operating system to the rest of the
class.

<p>The operating system you will build, called <i>JOS</i>, will have
Unix-like functions (e.g., fork, exec), but is implemented in an
exokernel style (i.e., the Unix functions are implemented mostly as
user-level library instead of built-in to the kernel). The major parts
of the JOS operating system are: <ol> <li>Booting <li>Memory management
<li>User-level environments<li>Preemptive multitasking <li>File system
and spawn<li>A shell </ol>

<p>We will provide skeleton code for pieces of JOS, but you will have to do
all the hard work.
You'll have design freedom for the details of the first few assignments,
and freedom over the whole design in the last assignments.
You'll find that xv6 helps you understand many of the goals you're
trying to achieve in JOS, but that JOS occupies a very different
point in the design and implementation space from xv6.

<p>The first 5 assignments are done individually.  The last assignment
is a team assignment.

<p>You will develop your JOS operating system for a standard x86-based
personal computer, the same one used for xv6.  To simplify development
we will use a complete machine simulator (Bochs) in the class for
development and debugging.  This simulator is real enough, however,
that you will be able to boot your own operating system on physical
hardware if you wish.

<p>At the end of the lab you will be able to find your way around the
source code of most operating systems, and more generally, be
comfortable with system software.  You will understand many operating
systems concepts in detail and will be able to use them in other
environments. You will also understand the x86 processor and the C
programming language well.

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>6.828 would not exist today had it not been for a wonderful set of past TAs
(Josh Cates, Russ Cox, Bryan Ford, Emil Sit, and Max Krohn). They made this class
a reality. Collectively we dedicate 6.828 to the memory of Josh Cates;
We hope that many students will be inspired by Josh's enthusiasm for
operating systems, and have named the operating system
<i>JOS</i>.

We are also grateful to the students and teaching staff at MIT, UCLA,
and NYU for their many contributions.
